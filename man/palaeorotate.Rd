\title{Palaeorotate fossil occurrences}
\usage{
palaeorotate(x, model = "Merdith2021", uncertainty = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{dataframe}. Fossil occurrences to be palaeogeographically
reconstructed. \code{x} should be a dataframe containing the following named
columns: "lng", "lat", "age". Age should be supplied in millions of years
before present (Ma). This format is intentionally strict to ensure that data
is entered correctly to prevent errors such as longitude and latitude being
confused.}

\item{model}{\code{character}. The name of the plate rotation model to be
used to reconstruct palaeocoordinates. Choose from: "Merdith2021",
"Scotese2018", and "Wright2013". The default is "Merdith2021". See details
below for further information on each model.}

\item{uncertainty}{\code{logical}. Should the uncertainty in
palaeogeographic reconstructions be returned? If set to TRUE, the
palaeocoordinates from the three plate rotation models are returned
("Merdith2021", "Scotese2018", and "Wright2013"), along with their
respective longitudinal and latitudinal range.}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} containing the original input occurrence
dataframe, age of rotation (Ma), the reference coordinates rotated, and the
reconstructed coordinates (i.e., palaeocoordinates). The "rot_age" column
refers to the age of rotation, and is deduced from the reference
age provided and the closest midpoint age of a stratigraphic stage. The
"rot_lng" and "rot_lat" columns refer to the reference coordinates rotated.
The "p_lng" and "p_lat" are the reconstructed coordinates for respective
plate rotation models.
}
\description{
A function to generate stage-level palaeocoordinates (0--540 Ma) for fossil
occurrence data (i.e., reconstruct the geographic distribution of organisms'
remains at time of deposition). Each occurrence is assigned
palaeocoordinates based on its current geographic distribution and age
estimate.
}
\details{
This function generates palaeocoordinates by spatiotemporally
linking present-day geographic coordinates and age estimates with a spatial
grid (1° x 1°) rotated to the midpoint of stratigraphic stages
(Geological Timescale, 2020;
\url{https://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2020-03.pdf}). As
such, palaeocoordinates can be efficiently generated for large datasets with
relatively little computational power. In addition, no additional software
or knowledge is required from the user (i.e. GPlates). However, it should be
noted that if specific ages of rotation are required, or fine-scale spatial
analyses are being conducted, use of \url{https://www.gplates.org} might be
preferable for the user (particularly if your occurrences are close to plate
boundaries).

The current palaeorotations (0--540 Ma) provided were generated using a
1° x 1° spatial grid with the GPlates software
\url{https://www.gplates.org} and three different plate rotation models
"Merdith2021" (Merdith et al., 2021), "Scotese2018"
(Scotese & Wright, 2018), and "Wright2013" (Wright et al. 2013).
